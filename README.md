# Itty-Bitty-Kitty
A text based game for coding pratice.

Idea:

The idea behind this project was to build a text based game orginally in C then moving up in diffrent languages as I progress through schoolor as opertunitys arrise.
This Is the first stage of Itty-Bitty Kitty, Designing the game.
I have several friends so far that are interested in helping create dialog, interactive items, objects and rooms.
Having a creative and fun dialog will make this project way more rewarding.

Story:

First thoughts are a family has a rat problem in there house, so they go to pick up a new cat (Thats you!).
Being just introduced to this world and taken into a new home there will be lots to explore and interact with.
The house will have a set number of rooms.(under 10 to start)
Each room should have there own feel, description, items, and surfaces.
There will be buffs throught the game like cat nip. (undecided buff)
There will also be harmfull items ( lazer pointer that will lead to random location)
The stats to keep track of are still undecided.
The main goal is finding the king rat and taking care of your new familys problem.

Anything is open for discussion, ideas, formating, correcting, editing  and adding.
This is the brainstorming and documenting phase!

Anyone is open to contribute and it would be very much appreciated!
